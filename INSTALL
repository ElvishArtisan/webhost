This is the installation file for the webhost5 package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building webhost:

Qt5 Toolkit, v5.9 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

SYSTEMD
On some systems utilizing Systemd, the Apache httpd service is configured
to use a chrooted filesystem for CGI processes, which will break certain
WebHost features --e.g. the UPDATE command.  To defeat this, change the
'PrivateTmp=' directive to 'false' in the httpd service definition
(located in '/usr/lib/systemd/system/' on RHEL 7), and then run:

	 systemctl daemon-reload
